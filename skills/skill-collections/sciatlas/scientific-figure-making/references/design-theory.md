# Publication Figure Design Theory (Derived from Repository Scripts)

This theory is inferred from the Python plotting scripts in the [figures4papers](https://github.com/ChenLiu-1996/figures4papers) repository (the `figure_*` project folders). See [demos.md](demos.md) for links to those demos.

## 1) Core Matplotlib Style System

The dominant house style is minimalist, high-contrast, and publication-oriented:

- Typography:
  - Primary: `font.family = 'helvetica'` (used in 16 scripts).
  - Secondary exception: `font.family = 'sans-serif'` (2 scripts, mostly geometric illustrations).
  - Practical portability recommendation: prefer fallback stack `['Arial', 'Helvetica', 'DejaVu Sans', 'sans-serif']`.
- Size hierarchy:
  - Large-panel bar/comparison figures: `font.size = 24`, `axes.linewidth = 3`.
  - Paper subfigures/compact analytic plots: `font.size = 15-16`, `axes.linewidth = 2`.
- Axes cleanup:
  - `axes.spines.right = False`
  - `axes.spines.top = False`
- LaTeX usage:
  - `text.usetex = True` appears in TeX-heavy scripts (6 files), especially when math-rich labels are needed.
- Vector text:
  - `svg.fonttype = 'none'` appears when preserving editable text in vector exports.

## 2) Export and Output Policy

- DPI defaults:
  - Standard: `dpi=300` (dominant: 23 save calls).
  - Very dense bar panels: `dpi=600` (used in ImmunoStruct bars).
- Layout finalization:
  - `fig.tight_layout(pad=2)` is the default finishing pass (21 occurrences).
  - `pad=1` is used for compact multi-panel plots.
- Mostly opaque white-background output; occasional `bbox_inches='tight'` with explicit `pad_inches` for edge-to-edge composites.

## 3) Color Theory and Palette Structure

The repository uses a consistent semantic palette family:

- Anchor/brand blue:
  - `#0F4D92` and `#3775BA` (method-of-interest / reference baseline).
- Green performance bands (often incremental gains):
  - `#DDF3DE`, `#AADCA9`, `#8BCF8B`.
- Warm red/pink comparator bands:
  - `#F6CFCB`, `#E9A6A1`, `#B64342`.
- Neutral support grays:
  - `#CFCECE`, `#767676`, `#4D4D4D`, `#272727`.
- Occasional accent/highlight colors:
  - Gold `#FFD700`, magenta-like `#EA84DD`, teal `#42949E`, violet `#9A4D8E`.

Design intent:

- Use blue for "proposed" or key method.
- Use green shades for related positives/improvements.
- Use pink/red shades for alternatives or contrasts.
- Keep neutrals for baselines and background categories.

## 4) Layout and Composition Logic

Common geometric/layout decisions:

- **Ultra-Wide Aspect Ratios:** For multi-metric comparisons (e.g., 3-4 metrics), the repository uses extremely wide canvases (e.g., `figsize=(45, 12)` or `(28, 6)`). This prevents vertical crowding and allows metrics to be read as a narrative from left to right.
- **Dedicated Legend Panels:** In complex multi-axis figures, a sub-plot is often dedicated solely to the legend (`ax.set_axis_off()`). This keeps the data panels clean and prevents legend boxes from overlapping critical data regions.
- **Categorical Abstracting:** Category bars usually hide x-tick labels (`ax.set_xticks([])`) and rely on legends/titles instead. This is particularly effective when comparing many methods across multiple metrics.
- **Dynamic Y-Axis Scaling:** Y-limits are manually tightened to relevant ranges (often derived from `data.min() - data.std()`), emphasizing comparative differences rather than absolute values.
- **Consistency over Embellishment:** Multi-panel consistency is favored over per-axis embellishment. All subplots in a row share the same font sizes, linewidths, and color semantic mapping.

## 5) Bar Encoding Strategy

For publication-grade grouped/ablation bars:

- **In-Place Annotation:** Scientific values are often printed directly above bars (`ax.text`) with large fonts (36pt) to make exact numbers readable without a grid.
- **Manual Tick Positioning:** Uses `FixedLocator` for precise control over Y-axis granularity.
- **Strong edge treatment:** Bars use black edges (`edgecolor='black'`) with `linewidth=1.5-3` for sharp separation.
- **Alpha-Based Ablation:** Ablation studies often use the same primary color (e.g., `blue_secondary`) with varying `alpha` levels (0.2 to 1.0) to represent the "completeness" of a method.
- **Hatch Encoding:** Optional hatch channels (slashes/backslashes/dots) are used for subtype overlays to remain readable in grayscale print.

## 6) Trend/Line Encoding Strategy

- Limited line count per axis (usually 2-4 primary curves).
- Use consistent line width around `2-3` with controlled alpha.
- Use `fill_between` for uncertainty when needed.
- Keep grid minimal or absent; rely on axis ticks and direct legend reading.

## 7) Scatter/Illustration Encoding Strategy

- Dense geometric scenes use lowered alpha and muted fills.
- Important trajectories/relations use saturated warm accents with arrows.
- Axis ticks often removed for conceptual diagrams.

## 8) Recommended Reusable rcParams Preset

```python
PUBLICATION_RCPARAMS = {
    "font.family": ["Arial", "Helvetica", "DejaVu Sans", "sans-serif"],
    "font.size": 16,            # use 24 for large comparison bars
    "axes.spines.right": False,
    "axes.spines.top": False,
    "axes.linewidth": 2.5,      # 3 for big bars, 2 for compact figures
    "legend.frameon": False,
    "svg.fonttype": "none",
}
```

## 9) Recommended Default Palette

```python
PALETTE = {
    "blue_main": "#0F4D92",
    "blue_secondary": "#3775BA",
    "green_1": "#DDF3DE",
    "green_2": "#AADCA9",
    "green_3": "#8BCF8B",
    "red_1": "#F6CFCB",
    "red_2": "#E9A6A1",
    "red_strong": "#B64342",
    "neutral": "#CFCECE",
    "highlight": "#FFD700",
}
```

## 10) Reproduction Rules

To match the repository's visual identity for new figures:

1. Apply minimalist spines (top/right off), frameless legends, and explicit y-limits.
2. Use Helvetica/Arial-like sans fonts with larger sizing for bars.
3. Choose colors from the blue-green-red-neutral family above; avoid unrelated palettes.
4. Finalize with `tight_layout(pad=2)` and export at `dpi=300` (or `600` for dense bar panels).
5. Use hatch/edge encodings for print-safe category separation when bars overlap in hue.
