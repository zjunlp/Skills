## Rules

- Based on existing documentation styles in the `docs` folder, examples: `button.md`, `accordion.md`, etc.
- Based on same name story implementation in `crates/story/src/stories`, and refer the component API accurately.
- Use markdown `code` with link to reference the component API to docs.rs if applicable.
