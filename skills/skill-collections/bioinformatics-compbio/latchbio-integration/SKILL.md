# LatchBio Integration

## Overview

Latch is a Python framework for building and deploying bioinformatics workflows as serverless pipelines. Built on Flyte, create workflows with @workflow/@task decorators, manage cloud data with LatchFile/LatchDir, configure resources, and integrate Nextflow/Snakemake pipelines.

## Core Capabilities

The Latch platform provides four main areas of functionality:

### 1. Workflow Creation and Deployment
- Define serverless workflows using Python decorators
- Support for native Python, Nextflow, and Snakemake pipelines
- Automatic containerization with Docker
- Auto-generated no-code user interfaces
- Version control and reproducibility

### 2. Data Management
- Cloud storage abstractions (LatchFile, LatchDir)
- Structured data organization with Registry (Projects → Tables → Records)
- Type-safe data operations with links and enums
- Automatic file transfer between local and cloud
- Glob pattern matching for file selection

### 3. Resource Configuration
- Pre-configured task decorators (@small_task, @large_task, @small_gpu_task, @large_gpu_task)
- Custom resource specifications (CPU, memory, GPU, storage)
- GPU support (K80, V100, A100)
- Timeout and storage configuration
- Cost optimization strategies

### 4. Verified Workflows
- Production-ready pre-built pipelines
- Bulk RNA-seq, DESeq2, pathway analysis
- AlphaFold and ColabFold for protein structure prediction
- Single-cell tools (ArchR, scVelo, emptyDropsR)
- CRISPR analysis, phylogenetics, and more

## Quick Start

### Installation and Setup

```bash
# Install Latch SDK
python3 -m uv pip install latch

# Login to Latch
latch login

# Initialize a new workflow
latch init my-workflow

# Register workflow to platform
latch register my-workflow
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker installed and running
- Latch account credentials
- Python 3.8+

### Basic Workflow Example

```python
from latch import workflow, small_task
from latch.types import LatchFile

@small_task
def process_file(input_file: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """Process a single file"""
    # Processing logic
    return output_file

@workflow
def my_workflow(input_file: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """
    My bioinformatics workflow

    Args:
        input_file: Input data file
    """
    return process_file(input_file=input_file)
```

## Common Workflow Patterns

### Complete RNA-seq Pipeline

```python
from latch import workflow, small_task, large_task
from latch.types import LatchFile, LatchDir

@small_task
def quality_control(fastq: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """Run FastQC"""
    return qc_output

@large_task
def alignment(fastq: LatchFile, genome: str) -> LatchFile:
    """STAR alignment"""
    return bam_output

@small_task
def quantification(bam: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """featureCounts"""
    return counts

@workflow
def rnaseq_pipeline(
    input_fastq: LatchFile,
    genome: str,
    output_dir: LatchDir
) -> LatchFile:
    """RNA-seq analysis pipeline"""
    qc = quality_control(fastq=input_fastq)
    aligned = alignment(fastq=qc, genome=genome)
    return quantification(bam=aligned)
```

### GPU-Accelerated Workflow

```python
from latch import workflow, small_task, large_gpu_task
from latch.types import LatchFile

@small_task
def preprocess(input_file: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """Prepare data"""
    return processed

@large_gpu_task
def gpu_computation(data: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """GPU-accelerated analysis"""
    return results

@workflow
def gpu_pipeline(input_file: LatchFile) -> LatchFile:
    """Pipeline with GPU tasks"""
    preprocessed = preprocess(input_file=input_file)
    return gpu_computation(data=preprocessed)
```

### Registry-Integrated Workflow

```python
from latch import workflow, small_task
from latch.registry.table import Table
from latch.registry.record import Record
from latch.types import LatchFile

@small_task
def process_and_track(sample_id: str, table_id: str) -> str:
    """Process sample and update Registry"""
    # Get sample from registry
    table = Table.get(table_id=table_id)
    records = Record.list(table_id=table_id, filter={"sample_id": sample_id})
    sample = records[0]

    # Process
    input_file = sample.values["fastq_file"]
    output = process(input_file)

    # Update registry
    sample.update(values={"status": "completed", "result": output})
    return "Success"

@workflow
def registry_workflow(sample_id: str, table_id: str):
    """Workflow integrated with Registry"""
    return process_and_track(sample_id=sample_id, table_id=table_id)
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
1. Use type annotations for all parameters
2. Write clear docstrings (appear in UI)
3. Start with standard task decorators, scale up if needed
4. Break complex workflows into modular tasks
5. Implement proper error handling

### Data Management
6. Use consistent folder structures
7. Define Registry schemas before bulk entry
8. Use linked records for relationships
9. Store metadata in Registry for traceability

### Resource Configuration
10. Right-size resources (don't over-allocate)
11. Use GPU only when algorithms support it
12. Monitor execution metrics and optimize
13. Design for parallel execution when possible

### Development Workflow
14. Test locally with Docker before registration
15. Use version control for workflow code
16. Document resource requirements
17. Profile workflows to determine actual needs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Registration Failures:**
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check authentication with `latch login`
- Verify all dependencies in Dockerfile
- Use `--verbose` flag for detailed logs

**Resource Problems:**
- Out of memory: Increase memory in task decorator
- Timeouts: Increase timeout parameter
- Storage issues: Increase ephemeral storage_gib

**Data Access:**
- Use correct `latch:///` path format
- Verify file exists in workspace
- Check permissions for shared workspaces

**Type Errors:**
- Add type annotations to all parameters
- Use LatchFile/LatchDir for file/directory parameters
- Ensure workflow return type matches actual return
