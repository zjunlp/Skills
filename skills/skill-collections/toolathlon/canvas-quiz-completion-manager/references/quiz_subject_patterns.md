# Quiz Subject Patterns & Answer Heuristics

Common question patterns observed across academic subjects with correct answer indicators.

## Mathematics & Computer Science

### Calculus & Linear Algebra
- **Derivative of x²**: `2x` (power rule: d/dx[xⁿ] = n*xⁿ⁻¹)
- **Determinant of identity matrix**: `1` (all diagonal elements are 1)
- **Matrix multiplication dimensions**: (m×n) × (n×p) = (m×p)
- **Eigenvalue definition**: "A scalar by which an eigenvector is scaled"
- **Binary search complexity**: `O(log n)` (divides search space in half)

### Algorithms & Data Structures
- **Time complexity hierarchies**: O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²)
- **Best average sorting**: Merge Sort or Quick Sort (O(n log n))
- **LIFO principle**: Stack
- **FIFO principle**: Queue

### Databases & SQL
- **RDBMS**: Relational Database Management System
- **Primary key**: Must be unique and not null
- **SQL SELECT**: Retrieves data
- **Normalization purpose**: Reduces redundancy, improves integrity

### Software Engineering
- **Agile methodology**: Iterative, customer collaboration
- **Unit testing**: Tests individual components
- **Singleton pattern**: Ensures single instance
- **Microservices advantage**: Independent scalability/deployment

## Artificial Intelligence & NLP
- **Supervised learning**: Uses labeled training data
- **Neural network basic unit**: Neuron/Perceptron
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words/tokens
- **Stemming**: Reducing words to root form

## Philosophy & Logic
- **Kant's Formula of Humanity**: "Treat humanity as an end, never merely as means"
- **Valid inference patterns**: Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens
- **Logical fallacies**:
  - Hasty generalization: Small sample → broad conclusion
  - Ad hominem: Attacking person not argument
- **Rawls' veil of ignorance**: Impartiality from unknown position

## History & Social Sciences
- **Historical causation**: Economic factors often primary (depressions, shortages)
- **Total war**: Mobilizes entire population/economy
- **Political movements**: Often expose societal divisions

## Language & Grammar
- **Third person singular**: "doesn't" not "don't"
- **Synonyms**: enormous = huge, gigantic, massive
- **Antonyms**: enormous ≠ tiny, small

## Networking
- **OSI Model layers**:
  - 7: Application
  - 4: Transport (TCP/UDP)
  - 3: Network (routing, IP)
  - 2: Data Link (MAC)
  - 1: Physical
- **Default ports**: HTTP=80, HTTPS=443, SSH=22, FTP=21

## Answer Selection Strategy
1. **Eliminate obviously wrong answers** (contradictory, nonsensical)
2. **Look for precise technical definitions**
3. **Prefer answers with qualifiers** ("must be", "always", "never") when definitional
4. **In historical questions**, economic/social factors often correct
5. **In ethics questions**, principles over utilitarian calculations
6. **When in doubt**, choose the most specific, academically standard answer
