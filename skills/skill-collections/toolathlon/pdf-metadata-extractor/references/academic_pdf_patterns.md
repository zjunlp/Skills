# Common Patterns in Academic PDF Metadata

## Author & Affiliation Block Locations
The author and affiliation information is most commonly found in these locations on the first page:
1.  **Directly under the title**, before the abstract.
2.  In a **footer or header** on the first page.
3.  On a **separate title page** (page 1), with the abstract starting on page 2.

## Typical Formatting Cues
- **Author List:** Names are usually separated by commas, "and", or line breaks. First author is the first name listed.
- **Affiliation Markers:** Superscript numbers (e.g., `^1`, `^2`) or symbols (e.g., `*`, `†`) next to author names that correspond to numbered affiliation blocks below.
- **Affiliation Block:** Often prefaced with words like "University of", "Department of", "School of", "Institute for", "Laboratory of", or corporate names (e.g., "Google DeepMind", "Meta FAIR").
- **Correspondence Line:** Often contains the email and affiliation of the corresponding author, which may be the first author. Look for "Correspondence to:" or "Email:".

## Common PDF Sources & URL Patterns
- **OpenReview:** `https://openreview.net/pdf?id=<PAPER_ID>`
- **arXiv:** `https://arxiv.org/pdf/<ARXIV_ID>.pdf`
- **PMLR (Proceedings of Machine Learning Research):** `https://proceedings.mlr.press/v<VOLUME>/<PAPER_ID>.pdf`
- **ACL Anthology:** `https://aclanthology.org/<YEAR>.<CONFERENCE>-<VOLUME>.<PAGE>.pdf`
- **Company/Institutional Repositories:** URLs often contain `/pdf/` or end with `.pdf`.

## Google Scholar Profile Search Tips
- The most reliable result is usually the direct link: `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=<UNIQUE_ID>&hl=en`.
- Profile snippets often contain the author's institutional affiliation and verification status (e.g., "Verified email at ucl.ac.uk").
- If the exact name yields multiple results, add their institution to the search query.
