# Keywords for Identifying Author Roles

Use these keywords to parse publication sections in resumes and determine qualification.

## Qualifying Roles (Independent First-Author)
Candidates mentioning these phrases in relation to a publication **QUALIFY** for an interview.
*   **First Author**
*   **Lead Author**
*   **Sole Author** (strongest indicator)
*   **Primary Author**
*   **Corresponding Author** (if also listed as first author)

## Non-Qualifying Roles
Candidates with **ONLY** these roles do **NOT** qualify.
*   Second Author
*   Third Author
*   Fourth Author, etc.
*   Co-author (without "first" or "lead" prefix)
*   Contributor

## Parsing Guidance
*   Look for bullet points or lists under headings like "Publications", "Research Results", or "Academic Contributions".
*   The role is typically stated **before** the paper title (e.g., "**First Author**: 'Paper Title', Conference Year").
*   If multiple publications are listed, the candidate qualifies if **any one** publication has a qualifying role.
