# Transit Planning Glossary

## Common Transit Modes (Google Maps API)
- **TRANSIT**: Generic public transport. In Singapore context, this typically resolves to MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) or LRT.
- **SUBWAY**: Underground rail system (MRT).
- **RAIL**: May refer to above-ground MRT or other rail services.
- **BUS**: Bus service.
- **WALKING**: Pedestrian segment.

## Key Route Components
- **Leg**: A continuous segment of travel using one mode (e.g., one subway ride from Station A to Station B).
- **Transfer**: The point where you change from one vehicle/line to another, often involving a short walking segment.
- **Boarding Station**: The station where you enter a transit vehicle.
- **Alighting Station**: The station where you exit a transit vehicle.

## Singapore MRT Specifics
- **Lines are color-coded**: East-West Line (Green), North-South Line (Red), etc.
- **Station Codes**: Combine line code and number (e.g., EW12 for Bugis on East-West Line, DT14 for Bugis on Downtown Line).
- **Interchange Stations**: Stations where multiple lines meet (e.g., Bugis, Raffles Place). These appear as single points in a station list but serve multiple lines.
