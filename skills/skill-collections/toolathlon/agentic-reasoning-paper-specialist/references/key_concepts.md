# Key Concepts in Agentic Reasoning & Generalist Agents

## Core Paradigms
*   **Agentic Reasoning:** The capability of AI systems (typically LLM-based) to autonomously plan, execute, and adapt multi-step tasks using tools and external resources.
*   **Generalist Agent:** An AI agent designed with a unified architecture to handle a wide range of domains and tasks, as opposed to task-specific solutions.
*   **Self-Evolving/Self-Improving Agents:** Agents that can autonomously create, refine, and reuse tools or capabilities (e.g., generating Model Context Protocols) to adapt to new tasks.

## Notable Frameworks & Systems
*   **Alita:** A generalist agent framework emphasizing "minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution." It uses a web agent and dynamically generates MCPs.
*   **Alita-G:** An extension focused on self-evolving generative agents for agent generation.
*   **OpenAI Deep Research:** An agentic framework for autonomous multi-step research tasks.
*   **OctoTools:** A framework with standardized tool cards for multi-domain tasks.
*   **AutoAgent:** A zero-code platform for creating and deploying LLM-powered agents.
*   **OWL (Optimized Workforce Learning):** A multi-agent framework for real-world task automation.
*   **Smolagents:** A lightweight library for building agentic systems (base for Open Deep Research).

## Key Technologies & Protocols
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** An open protocol (by Anthropic) that standardizes how systems provide context and tools to LLMs. A core enabler for tool reuse and integration.
*   **Tool Creation:** The ability of agents to autonomously generate code scripts or functions to solve specific sub-tasks.

## Important Benchmarks & Datasets
*   **GAIA:** A benchmark for evaluating general-purpose AI assistants with real-world, human-like questions across three difficulty levels.
*   **MathVista:** A benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in visual contexts.
*   **PathVQA:** A medical visual question answering dataset.
