# Back-to-Back Configuration Definitions

## Core Configurations
The analysis categorizes consecutive game pairs (back-to-back sets) into four mutually exclusive configurations based on game location sequence:

1. **HA (Home-Away)**
   - Day 1: Team plays at **Home**
   - Day 2: Team plays **Away**
   - *Typical scenario*: Team finishes a homestand and travels for an away game.

2. **AH (Away-Home)**
   - Day 1: Team plays **Away**
   - Day 2: Team plays at **Home**
   - *Typical scenario*: Team returns from a road trip to play at home.

3. **HH (Home-Home)**
   - Day 1: Team plays at **Home**
   - Day 2: Team plays at **Home**
   - *Typical scenario*: Consecutive home games during a homestand.

4. **AA (Away-Away)**
   - Day 1: Team plays **Away**
   - Day 2: Team plays **Away**
   - *Typical scenario*: Consecutive away games during a road trip.

## Analysis Assumptions
- **Consecutive Days**: Games are considered "back-to-back" if they occur on consecutive calendar days (difference of 1 day).
- **Team Perspective**: Analysis is performed from each team's individual schedule perspective.
- **Neutral Sites**: Games at neutral sites should be classified based on the team's designation (usually as "Away" unless specified as the designated home team).

## Common Patterns
- High **AA** counts often indicate compact road trips or challenging travel schedules.
- High **HH** counts suggest extended homestands, which can be advantageous.
- **HA** and **AH** configurations involve travel between games, which may impact team performance due to fatigue.

## Adapting for Different Sports
- **NHL**: 82-game season, frequent back-to-backs due to arena scheduling.
- **NBA**: 82-game season, similar back-to-back frequency.
- **MLB**: 162-game season, fewer true back-to-backs (more series-based scheduling).
- **NFL**: 17-game season, rarely has back-to-back games (weekly schedule).
