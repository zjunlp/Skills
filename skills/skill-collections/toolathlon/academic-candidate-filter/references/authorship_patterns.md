# Authorship Pattern Reference

This document catalogs common patterns for identifying authorship in academic resumes and application materials.

## Primary/First Author Indicators
These patterns indicate the candidate was the primary (first) author:

### Explicit Markers
- `First Author: "Paper Title", Venue Year`
- `**First Author**: "Paper Title", Venue Year`
- `<strong>First Author</strong>: "Paper Title", Venue Year`
- `Author (first): "Paper Title", Venue Year`

### Implicit Markers (Context-Dependent)
- `"Paper Title", Venue Year (First Author)`
- Listed first in a bibliography where authorship is explicitly attributed
- `Lead author: "Paper Title"`

## Sole/Independent Author Indicators
These patterns indicate the candidate was the only author:

### Explicit Markers
- `Sole Author: "Paper Title", Venue Year`
- `**Sole Author**: "Paper Title", Venue Year`
- `Independent Author: "Paper Title", Venue Year`
- `Single Author: "Paper Title", Venue Year`

### Implicit Markers
- `Author: "Paper Title", Venue Year` (when no other authors are mentioned in the entry)
- `"Paper Title", Venue Year` (when listed alone in a publications section with no co-authors mentioned)

## Non-Qualifying Authorship Patterns
These do NOT count as independent/first-author publications:
- `Second Author: ...`
- `Third Author: ...`
- `Co-author: ...`
- `Collaborator: ...`
- `Contributing Author: ...`
- Being listed first in a citation without explicit authorship attribution (e.g., `"Smith, J. et al. Paper Title"`)

- Publications
- Research Results
- Academic Contributions
- Journal Articles
- Conference Papers
- Selected Publications
- Research Output
