## General Activation Principles
1. **State Verification:** Always check device state before and after activation.
2. **Material Readiness:** Activation should only occur after materials are properly loaded.
3. **Energy Consumption:** Activated devices consume energy; deactivate when not in use.
4. **Process Monitoring:** Use measurement tools (thermometer, stopwatch) to monitor activated processes.
