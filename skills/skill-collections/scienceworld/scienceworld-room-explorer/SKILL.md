name: scienceworld-room-explorer
description: This skill performs an initial survey of a specified room to identify all visible objects and their states. It should be triggered when the agent first enters a new location or needs to refresh its understanding of the environment. The skill uses the 'look around' action and returns a detailed observation of the room's contents, which serves as the foundational context for subsequent object interaction tasks.

# Instructions

## Purpose
Use this skill to establish a foundational understanding of your immediate environment. It is the critical first step for any task requiring object interaction, inventory assessment, or spatial reasoning.

## When to Use
1.  **Upon entering a new room.**
2.  When the task requires identifying available resources.
3.  Before planning a complex sequence of actions (e.g., building a circuit, mixing chemicals).
4.  If the state of the environment may have changed (e.g., after using an object, or if a long time has passed).

## Core Action
Execute the `look around` action. This is the only action required for this skill.

## Output Processing
1.  The observation returned by `look around` is your primary output.
2.  Parse this observation to create a mental inventory. Key elements to note:
    *   **Room Name:** The identified location.
    *   **Objects:** List all items, containers, and devices.
    *   **Object States:** Note if devices are on/off, containers are open/closed, or if objects contain other items.
    *   **Connections:** Note any pre-existing wire connections or object placements.
    *   **Exits:** Identify doors to other rooms and their state (open/closed).

## Integration with Other Skills
The observation generated by this skill is essential context for downstream tasks. Before performing actions like `pick up`, `connect`, or `use`, always ensure your understanding of object locations and states is current by running this skill if needed.

**Do not** use this skill for examining specific objects in detail; use the `examine OBJ` or `look at OBJ` actions for that purpose.
