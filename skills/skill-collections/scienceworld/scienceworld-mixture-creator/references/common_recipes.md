# Common Chemical Recipes

This document lists observed chemical mixtures from the execution trajectory. Use this for reference when planning synthesis tasks.

## Recipe: Salt Water
- **Target Substance:** `salt water`
- **Required Ingredients:** `sodium chloride`, `water`
- **Process:**
    1.  Obtain a container (e.g., `glass cup`).
    2.  Place `sodium chloride` into the container.
    3.  Add `water` to the same container (e.g., by moving the container to an activated `sink`).
    4.  Execute `mix <container>`.

## General Workflow for Any Mixture
1.  **Find Recipe:** Locate and `read` a recipe note or book in the environment (common in `workshop`).
2.  **Gather Ingredients:** Explore rooms to find the listed substances. Use `look around` and `examine` objects.
3.  **Acquire Container:** Find an empty container (e.g., `cup`, `bowl`, `pot`) using `look around`. `pick up` the container.
4.  **Combine Ingredients:** Use `move <ingredient> to <container>` or `pour <ingredient> into <container>` to place all ingredients into the same container. Ensure the container is in your inventory afterward (`pick up <container>`).
5.  **Execute Mix:** Use the `scienceworld-mixture-creator` skill: `mix <container>`.
