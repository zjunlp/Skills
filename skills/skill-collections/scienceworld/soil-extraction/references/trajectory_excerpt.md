# Relevant Trajectory Excerpts for Soil Extraction

The following actions from the provided trajectory demonstrate the core, repeatable pattern of the soil-extraction skill.

## Pattern: Dig -> Collect
This sequence was successfully executed three times to obtain soil for three flower pots.

1.  **First Extraction:**
    *   Action: `use shovel in inventory on ground`
    *   Observation: `You dig a hole in the ground, and place the soil nearby.`
    *   Follow-up: `pick up soil`

2.  **Second Extraction:**
    *   Action: `use shovel in inventory on ground`
    *   Observation: `You dig a hole in the ground, and place the soil nearby.`
    *   Follow-up: `pick up soil`

3.  **Third Extraction:**
    *   Action: `use shovel in inventory on ground`
    *   Observation: `You dig a hole in the ground, and place the soil nearby.`
    *   Follow-up: `pick up soil`

## Key Environmental Context
*   **Location:** All extractions were performed in the `outside` room.
*   **Tool State:** The `shovel` was in the agent's inventory prior to each `use` command.
*   **Result Consistency:** Each `use` command reliably produced `soil` as a distinct, collectible object.
