# Skill Application Example: Growing an Avocado Plant

This document illustrates how the `scienceworld-tool-user` skill was applied in a specific trajectory to progress a task.

## Scenario: Digging Soil with a Shovel
**Goal:** Obtain soil for planting an avocado seed.
**Prerequisites Met:**
1.  Tool (`shovel`) was acquired via `pick up shovel` in the greenhouse.
2.  Target (`ground`) was identified in the `outside` location.

**Skill Execution:**
*   **Action:** `use shovel on ground`
*   **System Feedback:** "You dig a hole in the ground, and place the soil nearby."
*   **Post-Action:** The agent then used `pick up soil` to collect the result.

## Outcome
The successful use of the tool transformed the environment, creating a new resource (`soil`) that was essential for the next step (planting the seed in a flower pot). This demonstrates the skill's role in enabling physical task progression.
