# ScienceWorld Action Glossary
This is a quick reference for common actions used in task execution. Use `look around` and `teleport to LOC` as the primary tools for the navigation and observation phases of this skill.

## Core Navigation & Observation
*   `teleport to LOC`: Instantly move to a named room/location. Use this first if a target location is specified.
*   `look around`: Describes the current room and lists all visible objects, agents, and doors. Use this immediately after arriving at the target location.

## Object Interaction (Use as needed for final step)
*   `examine OBJ`: Get a detailed description of a specific object.
*   `look at OBJ`: List the contents inside a container object.
*   `focus on OBJ`: Signal intent or select a specific object as the task target.
*   `pick up OBJ`: Move an object into your inventory.
*   `use OBJ [on OBJ]`: Operate a device or apply an item.

## Environment Notes
*   **Containers are open:** You can directly `look at` or `take from` containers without needing to `open` them first.
*   **Rooms:** kitchen, foundry, workshop, bathroom, outside, living room, bedroom, greenhouse, art studio, hallway.
