# Action Primer for ScienceWorld

## Core Validation & Inspection Actions
*   `focus on OBJ`: The primary action for signaling intent and performing a basic operational check on a tool. Use this for validation.
*   `examine OBJ`: Provides a detailed description of an object's properties. Use for in-depth inspection *after* validation if needed.
*   `look at OBJ`: Describes a container's contents. Not typically used for tool validation.

## Common Tool Contexts
Tools often appear in standard locations:
*   **Kitchen:** `thermometer`, `stopwatch`, `lighter` on counters or tables.
*   **Workshop/Foundry:** More specialized instruments.
*   **Containers:** `fridge`, `cupboard`, `drawer`. Assume they are open.

## Navigation Note
Use `teleport to LOC` to move efficiently between rooms when searching for a tool.
