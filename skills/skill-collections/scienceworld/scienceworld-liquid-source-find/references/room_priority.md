# Room Priority Guide for Liquid Sources

This guide ranks rooms based on the observed likelihood of containing accessible liquids in the ScienceWorld environment. Use this to inform the search order.

## Tier 1: High Probability
*   **Kitchen:** Contains multiple fixed sources (`sink`) and portable containers (`cup`, `pot`, `jar`). Often has consumable liquids (e.g., `orange juice` in fridge).
*   **Bathroom:** Contains fixed sources (`sink`, `toilet`, `bathtub`). Frequently has `water`.

## Tier 2: Medium Probability
*   **Greenhouse:** Contains a `sink` and often `jug` containers for watering plants.
*   **Workshop:** May contain beakers, flasks, or other lab equipment that could hold liquids. Check tables and containers.

## Tier 3: Low Probability
*   **Art Studio:** May contain `paint` in cups or jugs. Could have water for cleaning brushes.
*   **Living Room / Bedroom / Hallway:** Typically dry rooms. Only check if all other options are exhausted; look for any stray `cup` or `bottle`.

## Tier 4: Very Low Probability
*   **Foundry, Outside:** Not observed in the trajectory to contain standard liquids. Check only if explicitly relevant to the task (e.g., needing molten metal or rainwater).
