# Action Glossary for Liquid Retrieval

A concise guide to the ScienceWorld actions relevant to this skill.

## Survey & Navigation
*   `teleport to LOC`: Instantly move to another room. Use this to jump between search locations.
*   `look around`: Get a description of the current room and all visible objects. **Use this first in every new room.**

## Inspection
*   `examine OBJ`: Get a detailed description of a specific object, including its current contents. Useful for checking what's inside a container you're holding.
*   `look at OBJ`: Describe a container's contents. Useful for checking fixed containers (e.g., `look at toilet`).

## Container & Liquid Manipulation
*   `pick up OBJ`: Move an object from the environment into your inventory.
*   `move OBJ to OBJ`: Move an object to a container or location. (e.g., `move cup to sink`).
*   `activate OBJ`: Turn on a device (e.g., `activate sink` to start water flow).
*   `deactivate OBJ`: Turn off a device (e.g., `deactivate sink`).
*   `pour OBJ into OBJ`: Transfer liquid between containers. (Not used in the base trajectory but potentially useful).
