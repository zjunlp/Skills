# Common Object Classifications for ScienceWorld

Use this reference to evaluate if an object matches a task's categorical requirement (e.g., "non-living thing", "container").

## Living vs. Non-Living
*   **Non-Living:** Tools, devices, components, furniture, substances (e.g., `wire`, `battery`, `light bulb`, `table`, `box`, `air`, `water`).
*   **Living:** Organisms, plants, animals (e.g., `mouse`, `fern`). If not explicitly described as living, assume non-living.

## Common Functional Types
*   **Container:** Objects that can hold other items (e.g., `box`, `freezer`, `beaker`, `drawer`). Described as "containing" something or having a "door".
*   **Electrical Component:** Objects used in circuits (e.g., `battery`, `wire`, `switch`, `light bulb`).
*   **Device/Tool:** Objects with an on/off state or specific function (e.g., `switch`, `freezer`, `microscope`).
*   **Furniture:** Large environmental objects (e.g., `table`, `cabinet`, `desk`). Often serve as surfaces or containers.
*   **Substance:** Materials like `air`, `water`, `chemical X`. Often described as "a substance called".

## Selection Heuristics
1.  **Portability:** Prefer small, handheld items (e.g., `wire`, `battery`) over large furniture (e.g., `table`) for "move" tasks.
2.  **Simplicity:** Prefer simple objects (e.g., a single `wire`) over complex devices (e.g., `ultra low temperature freezer`) unless specified.
3.  **Relevance:** In a scientific context, prefer lab-typical objects (components, tools) over generic ones when possible.
