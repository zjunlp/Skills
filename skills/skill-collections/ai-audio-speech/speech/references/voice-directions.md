# Voice directions

## Template
Use only the lines you need. Keep directions concise and aligned to the input text.

```
Voice Affect: <overall character and texture>
Tone: <attitude, formality, warmth>
Pacing: <slow, steady, brisk>
Emotion: <key emotions to convey>
Pronunciation: <words to enunciate or emphasize>
Pauses: <where to insert brief pauses>
Emphasis: <key phrases to stress>
Delivery: <cadence or rhythm notes>
```

## Best practices
- Keep 4 to 8 short lines. Avoid conflicting instructions.
- Prefer concrete guidance over adjectives alone.
- Do not rewrite the input text in the instructions; only guide delivery.
- If you need a language or accent, write the input text in that language.
- Repeat critical constraints (for example: "slow and steady") when iterating.
