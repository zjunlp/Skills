# Sample dataset for training a machine learning model.
# This dataset contains features and a target variable for demonstration purposes.
# You can replace this with your own dataset.

# Feature 1: Numerical feature representing age (e.g., of a customer).
# Feature 2: Categorical feature representing location (e.g., city).
# Feature 3: Binary feature representing whether a customer subscribed (1) or not (0).
# Target Variable: Represents the outcome we want to predict (e.g., customer churn).
