# Storage Heuristics for Household Environments

## Common Storage Patterns

### Kitchen Areas
- **Cutlery**: Drawers near preparation areas (countertops, sink)
- **Utensils**: Drawers containing spoons, forks likely also store knives
- **Food Items**: Cabinets, refrigerator, countertops
- **Cookware**: Cabinets near stove, drawers for small tools

### Living/Bedroom Areas
- **Personal Items**: Drawers in furniture, cabinets
- **Electronics**: Specific shelves or cabinets
- **Clothing**: Designated drawers or closets

## Decision Factors

### 1. Content Similarity
- Place objects with similar existing items
- Group by function (cutlery together, cookware together)
- Group by material (glass with glass, metal with metal)

### 2. Spatial Logic
- Store near where objects are used
- Keep related objects accessible together
- Consider workflow patterns

### 3. Environmental Constraints
- Clean items in clean storage
- Food items in food-safe areas
- Dangerous items in secure locations

## Exploration Priority Matrix

| Receptacle Type | Priority for General Storage | Special Considerations |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Empty drawers | High | First choice for most items |
| Drawers with similar items | High | Best for categorization |
| Cabinets | Medium | Good for larger items |
| Countertops | Low | Temporary storage only |
| Specialized (fridge, oven) | Very Low | Only for specific items |

## Quick Reference: Common Object Categories

### High-Frequency Kitchen Items
- **Cutlery**: Check drawers first, especially those containing other utensils
- **Plates/Bowls**: Cabinets near dining areas
- **Cooking Tools**: Drawers near stove, hanging racks
- **Food**: Refrigerator (perishable), cabinets (non-perishable)

### General Household Items
- **Cleaning Supplies**: Under sink, specific cabinets
- **Tools**: Designated drawers or boxes
- **Documents**: Desks, filing cabinets

## When to Stop Exploring
Stop and place the object when:
1. You find a receptacle containing identical/similar objects
2. You've checked all logical candidates
3. Time/action constraints require a decision
4. Environmental clues strongly suggest a location

## Fallback Strategies
If no ideal location found:
1. Choose the cleanest empty receptacle
2. Place near related objects (on same surface)
3. Return to original location (if temporary task)
