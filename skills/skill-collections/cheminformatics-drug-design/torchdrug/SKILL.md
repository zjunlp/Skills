from torchdrug import data
from rdkit import Chem

# SMILES → TorchDrug molecule
smiles = "CCO"
mol = data.Molecule.from_smiles(smiles)

# TorchDrug → RDKit
rdkit_mol = mol.to_molecule()

# RDKit → TorchDrug
rdkit_mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
mol = data.Molecule.from_molecule(rdkit_mol)
```

### With AlphaFold/ESM

Use predicted structures:
```python
from torchdrug import data

# Load AlphaFold predicted structure
protein = data.Protein.from_pdb("AF-P12345-F1-model_v4.pdb")

# Build graph with spatial edges
graph = protein.residue_graph(
    node_position="ca",
