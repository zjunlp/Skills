# Open Targets Database

## Overview

The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive resource for systematic identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic drug targets. It integrates publicly available datasets including human genetics, omics, literature, and chemical data to build and score target-disease associations.

**Key capabilities:**
- Query target (gene) annotations including tractability, safety, expression
- Search for disease-target associations with evidence scores
- Retrieve evidence from multiple data types (genetics, pathways, literature, etc.)
- Find known drugs for diseases and their mechanisms
- Access drug information including clinical trial phases and adverse events
- Evaluate target druggability and therapeutic potential

**Data access:** The platform provides a GraphQL API, web interface, data downloads, and Google BigQuery access. This skill focuses on the GraphQL API for programmatic access.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:

- **Target discovery:** Finding potential therapeutic targets for a disease
- **Target assessment:** Evaluating tractability, safety, and druggability of genes
- **Evidence gathering:** Retrieving supporting evidence for target-disease associations
- **Drug repurposing:** Identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed for new indications
- **Competitive intelligence:** Understanding clinical precedence and drug development landscape
- **Target prioritization:** Ranking targets based on genetic evidence and other data types
- **Mechanism research:** Investigating biological pathways and gene functions
- **Biomarker discovery:** Finding genes differentially expressed in disease
- **Safety assessment:** Identifying potential toxicity concerns for drug targets

## Core Workflow

### 1. Search for Entities

Start by finding the identifiers for targets, diseases, or drugs of interest.

**For targets (genes):**
```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import search_entities

# Search by gene symbol or name
results = search_entities("BRCA1", entity_types=["target"])
# Returns: [{"id": "ENSG00000012048", "name": "BRCA1", ...}]
```

**For diseases:**
```python
# Search by disease name
results = search_entities("alzheimer", entity_types=["disease"])
# Returns: [{"id": "EFO_0000249", "name": "Alzheimer disease", ...}]
```

**For drugs:**
```python
# Search by drug name
results = search_entities("aspirin", entity_types=["drug"])
# Returns: [{"id": "CHEMBL25", "name": "ASPIRIN", ...}]
```

**Identifiers used:**
- Targets: Ensembl gene IDs (e.g., `ENSG00000157764`)
- Diseases: EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology) IDs (e.g., `EFO_0000249`)
- Drugs: ChEMBL IDs (e.g., `CHEMBL25`)

### 2. Query Target Information

Retrieve comprehensive target annotations to assess druggability and biology.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_target_info

target_info = get_target_info("ENSG00000157764", include_diseases=True)

# Access key fields:
# - approvedSymbol: HGNC gene symbol
# - approvedName: Full gene name
# - tractability: Druggability assessments across modalities
# - safetyLiabilities: Known safety concerns
# - geneticConstraint: Constraint scores from gnomAD
# - associatedDiseases: Top disease associations with scores
```

**Key annotations to review:**
- **Tractability:** Small molecule, antibody, PROTAC druggability predictions
- **Safety:** Known toxicity concerns from multiple databases
- **Genetic constraint:** pLI and LOEUF scores indicating essentiality
- **Disease associations:** Diseases linked to the target with evidence scores

Refer to `references/target_annotations.md` for detailed information about all target features.

### 3. Query Disease Information

Get disease details and associated targets/drugs.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_disease_info

disease_info = get_disease_info("EFO_0000249", include_targets=True)

# Access fields:
# - name: Disease name
# - description: Disease description
# - therapeuticAreas: High-level disease categories
# - associatedTargets: Top targets with association scores
```

### 4. Retrieve Target-Disease Evidence

Get detailed evidence supporting a target-disease association.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_target_disease_evidence

# Get all evidence
evidence = get_target_disease_evidence(
    ensembl_id="ENSG00000157764",
    efo_id="EFO_0000249"
)

# Filter by evidence type
genetic_evidence = get_target_disease_evidence(
    ensembl_id="ENSG00000157764",
    efo_id="EFO_0000249",
    data_types=["genetic_association"]
)

# Each evidence record contains:
# - datasourceId: Specific data source (e.g., "gwas_catalog", "chembl")
# - datatypeId: Evidence category (e.g., "genetic_association", "known_drug")
# - score: Evidence strength (0-1)
# - studyId: Original study identifier
# - literature: Associated publications
```

**Major evidence types:**
1. **genetic_association:** GWAS, rare variants, ClinVar, gene burden
2. **somatic_mutation:** Cancer Gene Census, IntOGen, cancer biomarkers
3. **known_drug:** Clinical precedence from approved/clinical drugs
4. **affected_pathway:** CRISPR screens, pathway analyses, gene signatures
5. **rna_expression:** Differential expression from Expression Atlas
6. **animal_model:** Mouse phenotypes from IMPC
7. **literature:** Text-mining from Europe PMC

Refer to `references/evidence_types.md` for detailed descriptions of all evidence types and interpretation guidelines.

### 5. Find Known Drugs

Identify drugs used for a disease and their targets.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_known_drugs_for_disease

drugs = get_known_drugs_for_disease("EFO_0000249")

# drugs contains:
# - uniqueDrugs: Total number of unique drugs
# - uniqueTargets: Total number of unique targets
# - rows: List of drug-target-indication records with:
#   - drug: {name, drugType, maximumClinicalTrialPhase}
#   - targets: Genes targeted by the drug
#   - phase: Clinical trial phase for this indication
#   - status: Trial status (active, completed, etc.)
#   - mechanismOfAction: How drug works
```

**Clinical phases:**
- Phase 4: Approved drug
- Phase 3: Late-stage clinical trials
- Phase 2: Mid-stage trials
- Phase 1: Early safety trials

### 6. Get Drug Information

Retrieve detailed drug information including mechanisms and indications.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_drug_info

drug_info = get_drug_info("CHEMBL25")

# Access:
# - name, synonyms: Drug identifiers
# - drugType: Small molecule, antibody, etc.
# - maximumClinicalTrialPhase: Development stage
# - mechanismsOfAction: Target and action type
# - indications: Diseases with trial phases
# - withdrawnNotice: If withdrawn, reasons and countries
```

### 7. Get All Associations for a Target

Find all diseases associated with a target, optionally filtering by score.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_target_associations

# Get associations with score >= 0.5
associations = get_target_associations(
    ensembl_id="ENSG00000157764",
    min_score=0.5
)

# Each association contains:
# - disease: {id, name}
# - score: Overall association score (0-1)
# - datatypeScores: Breakdown by evidence type
```

**Association scores:**
- Range: 0-1 (higher = stronger evidence)
- Aggregate evidence across all data types using harmonic sum
- NOT confidence scores but relative ranking metrics
- Under-studied diseases may have lower scores despite good evidence

## Best Practices

### Target Prioritization Strategy

When prioritizing drug targets:

1. **Start with genetic evidence:** Human genetics (GWAS, rare variants) provides strongest disease relevance
2. **Check tractability:** Prefer targets with clinical or discovery precedence
3. **Assess safety:** Review safety liabilities, expression patterns, and genetic constraint
4. **Evaluate clinical precedence:** Known drugs indicate druggability and therapeutic window
5. **Consider multiple evidence types:** Convergent evidence from different sources increases confidence
6. **Validate mechanistically:** Pathway evidence and biological plausibility
7. **Review literature manually:** For critical decisions, examine primary publications

### Evidence Interpretation

**Strong evidence indicators:**
- Multiple independent evidence sources
- High genetic association scores (especially GWAS with L2G > 0.5)
- Clinical precedence from approved drugs
- ClinVar pathogenic variants with disease match
- Mouse models with relevant phenotypes

**Caution flags:**
- Single evidence source only
- Text-mining as sole evidence (requires manual validation)
- Conflicting evidence across sources
- High essentiality + ubiquitous expression (poor therapeutic window)
- Multiple safety liabilities

**Score interpretation:**
- Scores rank relative strength, not absolute confidence
- Under-studied diseases have lower scores despite potentially valid targets
- Weight expert-curated sources higher than computational predictions
- Check evidence breakdown, not just overall score

### Common Workflows

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **API is for exploratory queries:** For systematic analyses of many targets/diseases, use data downloads or BigQuery
2. **Scores are relative, not absolute:** Association scores rank evidence strength but don't predict clinical success
3. **Under-studied diseases score lower:** Novel or rare diseases may have strong evidence but lower aggregate scores
4. **Evidence quality varies:** Weight expert-curated sources higher than computational predictions
5. **Requires biological interpretation:** Scores and evidence must be interpreted in biological and clinical context
6. **No authentication required:** All data is freely accessible, but cite appropriately
