## Overview

This skill empowers Claude to assist users in preparing for a SOC2 audit. It automates the process of gathering evidence, analyzing security controls, and identifying potential compliance gaps, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in SOC2 preparation.

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Request**: Claude identifies the user's intent to prepare for a SOC2 audit.
2. **Gather Evidence**: The `soc2-audit-helper` plugin is invoked to collect relevant data and artifacts from the user's environment based on common SOC2 requirements.
3. **Generate Report**: The plugin generates a comprehensive report summarizing the current state of compliance, highlighting potential areas of concern.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill activates when you need to:
- Prepare for a SOC2 audit.
- Assess current security controls against SOC2 requirements.
- Gather evidence for SOC2 compliance.

## Examples

### Example 1: Generating a SOC2 Readiness Report

User request: "Generate a SOC2 readiness report for my AWS environment."

The skill will:
1. Invoke the `soc2-audit-helper` plugin.
2. Generate a report detailing the compliance status of the AWS environment based on SOC2 criteria.

### Example 2: Identifying Compliance Gaps

User request: "What are the compliance gaps in my current security posture related to SOC2?"

The skill will:
1. Invoke the `soc2-audit-helper` plugin.
2. Analyze the current security configuration and identify areas where it falls short of SOC2 requirements.

## Best Practices

- **Specificity**: Provide as much detail as possible about the environment and specific SOC2 requirements.
- **Regular Updates**: Run the audit helper regularly to track progress and identify new compliance gaps.
- **Review Findings**: Carefully review the generated reports and address any identified issues promptly.

## Integration

This skill can be integrated with other security and compliance tools to provide a more comprehensive view of the organization's security posture. For example, it can be used in conjunction with vulnerability scanners and configuration management tools to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
